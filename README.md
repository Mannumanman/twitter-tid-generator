# twitter-tid-generator
This project is a fully working generator for the `X-Client-Transaction-Id` header on Twitter, used in a majority of API requests.

This was made for my blog at https://antibot.blog and was a three part series! I hope someone can get some use out of this, or maybe just learn from how I went about porting the code, the issues I ran into, etc.
